    "## Background\n",
    "WeRateDogs (@dog_rates) is a wildly popular Twitter account which is known for enthusiastically rating submissions of dog photos and making conjectures about the behavior and quirks (both wholesome and mischevious) of the depicted canines. Since the account's creation, the administrator has rated thousands of dogs, and has amassed a strong following which is reflected in the numbers of favorites and retweets each of its tweets garners. The popularity of this account marks it as a source of interest, and the volume of its recorded media makes it a perfect candidate for programmatic data analysis."

    "## Method\n",
    "To uncover insights on the tweets posted by WeRateDogs, I gathered approximately 2300 tweets posted by the account between 2015 and 2017 and ran some analysis on the text bodies of each tweet for info. I also relied heavily on a neural network developed by Udacity which determined the breed of each dog in question. After cleaning operations, I was left with approximately 1400 tweets to analyze."

Although some dogs are rated poorly (WeRateDogs seems to dislike photos of dogs engaged in dangerous behavior, such as driving a car with mal-adjusted mirror), 75% scored a 10 or higher.\n",
